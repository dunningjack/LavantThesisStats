# River Lavant Thesis Project
## Premise
The project, working at the  University of Portsmouth, aims to quantify the impact of a sewage treatment plant on the physicochemical parameters and the macroinvertebrate response to these.
Data was collected using a EuTech PCD650 probe for DO/Temperature/pH/TDS, Hanna Instruments Nitrate and Phosphate Checkers, and NHBS Kick nets for samples.

## Hypotheses
1. Measures of diversity (BWMP, ASPT, Shannon, Simpson) decrease with increased nutrient concentrations
2. Measures of diversity are lower downstream than upstream
3. Sites exhibit the same physical parameters (pH/DO/TDS/Temp)
4. Nutrient concentrations (nitrate, phosphate) are the most significant driver of biodiversity decline in the river

## Data Analysis
Data is analysed using R, with a number of packages that afford the user the ability to clean data, fill in missing values, complete statistical tests and produce plots.
