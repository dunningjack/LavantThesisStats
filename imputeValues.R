#if imputating values, group US and DS differently and calculate means
#map shows USDS is probably largets driver so should be treated differently
#if taking averages overall then reduces precision

#not means for biodiversity indices or median?
#kNN imputation as mean bad options

#use site mean to fill in missing values, site-by-site
